        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>The Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης (tagēnitēs)<a href="#">[3]</a> or ταγηνίας (tagēnias),          
        <a href="#">[4]</a> all words deriving from τάγηνον (tagēnon), "frying pan".<a href="#">[5]</a> The earliest attested references to tagenias are in the works of
            the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus <a href="#">[6]</a> and Magnes.[7] Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled
            milk, and were served for breakfast. Another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (staititēs), from σταίτινος
            (staitinos), "of flour or dough of spelt", derived from σταῖς (stais), "flour of spelt".[12] Athenaeus mentions, in
            his Deipnosophistae, staititas topped with honey, sesame, and cheese.[13][14][15] The Middle English word pancake
            appears in English in the 15th century. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions alia dulcia, Latin for "other sweets". These were much different from
            what are known as pancakes today.

        <h2>Regional varieties</h2>          
            <h3>Africa</h3>
                <h4>Horn of Africa</h4>
                    <p>Pancakes in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia) are known as injera (sometimes transliterated as enjera, budenaa (Oromo), or canjeero (Somali)). Injera is a yeast-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally, it is made out of teff flour and is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Canjeero, also
                    known as lahooh or lahoh, is a similar kind of flatbread eaten in Somalia and Yemen.
                    Lahoh is a staple in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.     
                    <br> <br>

            </div>
                    In Eritrea and Ethiopia, injera are usually served with one or more stews known as wat or with salads (especially, for
                    instance, during periods of Ethiopian Orthodox fasting) or with other injera (injera firfir). The right hand is used to
                    tear small pieces from the injera to use to pick up and eat the stews or salads. The injera under these stews soaks up
                    juices and flavours and, after the stews and salads are finished, is also consumed. Injera thus acts simultaneously as
                    food, eating utensil and plate. When the "tablecloth" formed by the injera is finished, the meal is over.
                    <br> <br>
                    Lahoh is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.[19][20] It is often eaten along with honey,
                    ghee and tea. During lunch, lahoh is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.
                <h4>Kenya</h4>    
                    In Kenya, pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already
                    added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.
                <h4>South Africa</h4>
                    A "pancake" in South Africa is a crêpe. In Afrikaans, it is known as a pannekoek (plural pannekoeke) and, traditionally,
                    is prepared on gas stoves and eaten on wet and cold days. Pannekoeke are usually served with cinnamon-flavoured sugar
                    (and, sometimes, lemon juice) that is either allowed to dissolve into and soften them or, if their crispy texture is to
                    be retained, eaten immediately. They are a staple at Dutch Reformed Church fêtes.[21]
                    <br>
                    Plaatkoekies ("flapjacks", or lit. "plate cookies") are American-style "silver dollar" pancakes.
                <h4>Uganda</h4>       
                    In Uganda, pancakes are locally made with bananas (one of the staple foods of the country) and usually served as a
                    breakfast or as a snack option.</p>

                    <li>1 Tbsp Coconut Oil + more for frying</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup (180ml) Soy Milk (or another non-dairy milk)</li>

        <h2>Pancake Day</h3>
            <hr>   
            <p>Pancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which is known as "Pancake Day" in Canada,[58] the United
                Kingdom,[59] Ireland,[60] New Zealand, and Australia,[61] and "Pancake Tuesday" in Ireland and Scotland. <br>
                is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes
                were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No meat products should be  eaten during Lent.
            <br> <br>
                Charity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a "pancake race" each participant carries a pancake in a
                frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to
                have originated in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast
                when she heard the bells of St Peter and St Paul's Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to church,
                she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and
                still wearing her apron and headscarf.[62][63] Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney[64] and Liberal,                    Kansas have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are                    compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local
                schoolchildren and for men.
            <br> <br>
                The Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the
                House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of
                Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national brain injury
                charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury.[65][66]</p>
